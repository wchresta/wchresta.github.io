title: About
---
Hi! I'm a mathematician with an interest in programming, computer science
and security that goes back into my childhood. I have a MSc's degree in
Mathematics, a BSc in Physics from the University of Basel and a CAS ETH in
Computer Science from ETH Zurich. During my studies, I worked on
cryptographic algorithms, algebraic geometry, static analysis of protocols,
secure software engineering and architecture.

Currently, I work as a Security Architect overseeing the security aspects of
the design, implementation and software engineering process for financial
software.
